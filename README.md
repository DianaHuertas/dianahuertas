## About Me

I am an AI-focused product and strategy professional with a background in Information Science & Technology from Penn State University (GPA: 3.85).

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Artificial Intelligence
- Business Strategy
- Healthcare Systems
- Financial Risk Modeling
- AI Governance & Compliance

I specialize in translating complex machine learning systems into scalable, executive-ready solutions that drive measurable business impact.

I am particularly interested in AI product leadership within healthcare, financial infrastructure, and regulated environments.

## What I Do

I design AI-powered systems that:

- Transform operational workflows
- Improve decision-making through predictive modeling
- Integrate compliance and ethical AI governance
- Bridge engineering teams and executive stakeholders
- Turn data into strategic advantage

I focus on product vision, system architecture thinking, and real-world implementation — not just experimentation.
